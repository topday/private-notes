{#  This file allows customizing the appearance of the Trac installation.

    Add your customizations to the the end of the HTML <body> content here
    and rename the file to site_footer.html.

    Note that it will take precedence over a global site_footer.html placed
    in the directory specified by [inherit] templates_dir.

    More information about site appearance customization can be found here:
